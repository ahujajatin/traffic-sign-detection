# Traffic Sign Detection
I have built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of various traffic signs like 'Turn right ahead',' Keep Left','Speed Limit 70 km/h' etc. Using OpenCV, I have predicted the traffic sign on each image in a webcam video. In this project I have used ImageDataGenerator class of Keras package for data augmentation.
